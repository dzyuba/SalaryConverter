The online Wage and Salary Conversion Calculator is used to convert a wage stated in one periodic term (hourly, dayly, monthly etc.) into its equivalent stated in all other common periodic terms. Select a pay period (hourly, daily, monthly etc.) and enter a wage value for that pay period. Then click the Convert Wage button to see the wage converted to all pay periods.

This calculator can be helpful if you want to compare your present wage to a wage being offered by a prospective employer where each wage is stated in a different periodic term.
